# Local-RAG-Chatbot-Secure-Q-A-on-Private-Data

A local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to securely answer queries on private data without relying on external APIs. This project demonstrates ingesting large documents, generating embeddings, performing semantic search, and leveraging local large language models (LLMs) for privacy-preserving, domain-specific question answering.

---

## Features

- PDF Ingestion & Preprocessing: Efficiently load and preprocess large PDF documents.  
- Text Chunking: Split text into overlapping chunks to enhance retrieval quality.  
- Embeddings Generation: Use `all-mpnet-base-v2` from Sentence Transformers for semantic embeddings.  
- Semantic Search: Implement vector search for retrieving the most relevant context.  
- Local LLM Inference: Use Hugging Face's `google/gemma-7b-it` or `google/gemma-2b-it` models for generating context-aware answers locally.  
- Privacy & Control: Fully local pipeline ensuring complete data privacy without external API calls.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher  
- GPU with sufficient memory (recommended for LLM inference)  
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) with CUDA support  
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab  
- Other Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/himanshu-commits/Local-RAG-Chatbot-Secure-Q-A-on-Private-Data.git
   cd Local-RAG-Chatbot-Secure-Q-A-on-Private-Data
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Local_RAG.ipynb
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   jupyter lab Local_RAG.ipynb
   ```

---

## Usage

* Open `Local_RAG.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
* Follow the step-by-step cells to:

  * Ingest and preprocess PDFs
  * Chunk and embed text
  * Perform semantic search
  * Run local LLM inference for query answering
* Modify or extend the notebook for your own private data and use cases.

---

## Models Used

* Embedding Model: `all-mpnet-base-v2` from Sentence Transformers
* LLM: `google/gemma-7b-it` (7 billion parameters) or `google/gemma-2b-it` (2 billion parameters) from Hugging Face Transformers

---

## Key Learnings & Applications

* Understand the full RAG pipeline: document chunking, embedding generation, vector storage, retrieval, and context-augmented generation
* Experience GPU-accelerated local inference with LLMs
* Build private, domain-specific AI assistants for sensitive enterprise or personal data
* Applicable to industries like finance, healthcare, research, and anywhere privacy is critical
